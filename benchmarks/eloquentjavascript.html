equipped with a simple programming language, usually a variant of
<a name="key1"></a>BASIC. Interacting with the computer was closely integrated with
this language, and thus every computer-user, whether he wanted to or
not, would get a taste of it. Now that computers have become plentiful
and cheap, typical users don't get much further than clicking things
with a mouse. For most people, this works very well. But for those of
us with a natural inclination towards technological tinkering, the
removal of programming from every-day computer use presents something
of a barrier.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4adc934200807fbb" name="p4adc934200807fbb"> ¶ </a>Fortunately, as an effect of developments in the World Wide Web, it so
happens that every computer equipped with a modern web-browser also
has an environment for programming JavaScript. In today's spirit of
not bothering the user with technical details, it is kept well hidden,
but a web-page can make it accessible, and use it as a platform for
learning to program.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pe15267081702eb5" name="pe15267081702eb5"> ¶ </a>That is what this (hyper-)book tries to do.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><blockquote>I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn, nor arouse those
who are not anxious to give an explanation themselves. If I have
presented one corner of the square and they cannot come back to me
with the other three, I should not go over the points again.<br/><br/>― Confucius</blockquote><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7168e82dd605bf59" name="p7168e82dd605bf59"> ¶ </a>Besides explaining JavaScript, this book tries to be an introduction
to the basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is
hard. The fundamental rules are, most of the time, simple and clear.
But programs, while built on top of these basic rules, tend to become
complex enough to introduce their own rules, their own complexity.
Because of this, programming is rarely simple or predictable. As
Donald Knuth, who is something of a founding father of the field,
says, it is an <em>art</em>.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2849f125de87d3b5" name="p2849f125de87d3b5"> ¶ </a>To get something out of this book, more than just passive reading is
required. Try to stay sharp, make an effort to solve the exercises,
and only continue on when you are reasonably sure you understand the
material that came before.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><blockquote>The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone
is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be
created in the form of computer programs.<br/><br/>― Joseph Weizenbaum, <em>Computer Power and Human Reason</em></blockquote><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6fd53be181d82388" name="p6fd53be181d82388"> ¶ </a>A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a programmer,
it is the directing force that makes the computer do what it does, it
is data in the computer's memory, yet it controls the actions
performed on this same memory. Analogies that try to compare programs
to objects we are familiar with tend to fall short, but a
superficially fitting one is that of a machine. The gears of a
mechanical watch fit together ingeniously, and if the watchmaker was
any good, it will accurately show the time for many years. The
elements of a program fit together in a similar way, and if the
programmer knows what he is doing, the program will run without
crashing.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p48ff3e75bab11884" name="p48ff3e75bab11884"> ¶ </a>A computer is a machine built to act as a host for these immaterial
machines. Computers themselves can only do stupidly straightforward
things. The reason they are so useful is that they do these things at
an incredibly high speed. A program can, by ingeniously combining many
of these simple actions, do very complicated things.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1ff6d46adeaed61b" name="p1ff6d46adeaed61b"> ¶ </a>To some of us, writing computer programs is a fascinating game. A
program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, weightless,
growing easily under our typing hands. If we get carried away, its
size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the one
who created it. This is the main problem of programming. It is why so
much of today's software tends to crash, fail, screw up.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5a4281d62a20af99" name="p5a4281d62a20af99"> ¶ </a>When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the
skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued, made
simple in its complexity.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4e3bc648db1c061d" name="p4e3bc648db1c061d"> ¶ </a>Today, many programmers believe that this complexity is best managed
by using only a small set of well-understood techniques in their
programs. They have composed strict rules about the form programs
should have, and the more zealous among them will denounce those who
break these rules as <em>bad</em> programmers.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pb85bd0b48cb88dd" name="pb85bd0b48cb88dd"> ¶ </a>What hostility to the richness of programming! To try to reduce it to
something straightforward and predictable, to place a taboo on all the
weird and beautiful programs. The landscape of programming techniques
is enormous, fascinating in its diversity, still largely unexplored.
It is certainly littered with traps and snares, luring the
inexperienced programmer into all kinds of horrible mistakes, but that
only means you should proceed with caution, keep your wits about you.
As you learn, there will always be new challenges, new territory to
explore. The programmer who refuses to keep exploring will surely
stagnate, forget his joy, lose the will to program (and become a
manager).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6c59c7812ba8b9bb" name="p6c59c7812ba8b9bb"> ¶ </a>As far as I am concerned, the definite criterion for a program is
whether it is correct. Efficiency, clarity, and size are also
important, but how to balance these against each other is always a
matter of judgement, a judgement that each programmer must make for
himself. Rules of thumb are useful, but one should never be afraid to
break them.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6e133d7403fcf291" name="p6e133d7403fcf291"> ¶ </a>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming
languages. Programs looked something like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">00110001 00000000 00000000
00110001 00000001 00000001
00110011 00000001 00000010
01010001 00001011 00000010
00100010 00000010 00001000
01000011 00000001 00000000
01000001 00000001 00000001
00010000 00000010 00000000
01100010 00000000 00000000</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3be310f42eba4016" name="p3be310f42eba4016"> ¶ </a>That is a program to add the numbers from one to ten together, and
print out the result (1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55). It could run on a very
simple kind of computer. To program early computers, it was necessary
to set large arrays of switches in the right position, or punch holes
in strips of cardboard and feed them to the computer. You can imagine
how this was a tedious, error-prone procedure. Even the writing of
simple programs required much cleverness and discipline, complex ones
were nearly inconceivable.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4bd5ecf3f5dbb2e3" name="p4bd5ecf3f5dbb2e3"> ¶ </a>Of course, manually entering these arcane patterns of bits (which is
what the 1s and 0s above are generally called) did give the programmer
a profound sense of being a mighty wizard. And that has to be worth
something, in terms of job satisfaction.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p99870ffbdcd77f1" name="p99870ffbdcd77f1"> ¶ </a>Each line of the program contains a single instruction. It could be
written in English like this:</p><ol><li>Store the number 0 in memory location 0</li><li>Store the number 1 in memory location 1</li><li>Store the value of memory location 1 in memory location 2</li><li>Decrement the value in memory location 2 by the number 11</li><li>If the value in memory location 2 is the number 0, continue with instruction 9</li><li>Increment the value in memory location 0 by the value in memory location 1</li><li>Increment the value in memory location 1 by the number 1</li><li>Continue with instruction 3</li><li>Output the value of memory location 0</li></ol><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p28087410c8942294" name="p28087410c8942294"> ¶ </a>While that is more readable than the binary soup, it is still rather
unpleasant. It might help to use names instead of numbers for the
instructions and memory locations:</p><pre class="preformatted"> Set 'total' to 0
 Set 'count' to 1
[loop]
 Set 'compare' to 'count'
 Subtract 11 from 'compare'
 If 'compare' is zero, continue at [end]
 Add 'count' to 'total'
 Add 1 to 'count'
 Continue at [loop]
[end]
 Output 'total'</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p742448e76c15459b" name="p742448e76c15459b"> ¶ </a>At this point it is not too hard to see how the program works. Can
you? The first two lines give two memory locations their starting
values: <code>total</code> will be used to build up the result of the program,
and <code>count</code> keeps track of the number that we are currently looking
at. The lines using <code>compare</code> are probably the weirdest ones. What the
program wants to do is see if <code>count</code> is equal to 11, in order to
decide whether it can stop yet. Because the machine is so primitive,
it can only test whether a number is zero, and make a decision (jump)
based on that. So it uses the memory location labelled <code>compare</code> to
compute the value of <code>count - 11</code>, and makes a decision based on that
value. The next two lines add the value of <code>count</code> to the result, and
increment <code>count</code> by one every time the program has decided that it is
not 11 yet.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p485d88d71ab25ae7" name="p485d88d71ab25ae7"> ¶ </a>Here is the same program in JavaScript:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">total</span> = <span class="atom">0</span>, <span class="variable">count</span> = <span class="atom">1</span>;
<span class="keyword">while</span> (<span class="variable">count</span> &lt;= <span class="atom">10</span>) {
  <span class="variable">total</span> += <span class="variable">count</span>;
  <span class="variable">count</span> += <span class="atom">1</span>;
}
<span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">total</span>);</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p500d53fd9ae8deba" name="p500d53fd9ae8deba"> ¶ </a>This gives us a few more improvements. Most importantly, there is no
need to specify the way we want the program to jump back and forth
anymore. The magic word <code>while</code> takes care of that. It continues
executing the lines below it as long as the condition it was given
holds: <code>count &lt;= 10</code>, which means '<code>count</code> is less than or equal
to <code>10</code>'. Apparently, there is no need anymore to create a temporary
value and compare that to zero. This was a stupid little detail, and
the power of programming languages is that they take care of stupid
little details for us.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p71e06cf06ceceb6e" name="p71e06cf06ceceb6e"> ¶ </a>Finally, here is what the program could look like if we happened to
have the convenient operations <code>range</code> and <code>sum</code> available, which
respectively create a collection of numbers within a range and compute
the sum of a collection of numbers:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">print</span>(<span class="variable">sum</span>(<span class="variable">range</span>(<span class="atom">1</span>, <span class="atom">10</span>)));</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5748f0480052ee2d" name="p5748f0480052ee2d"> ¶ </a>The moral of this story, then, is that the same program can be
expressed in long and short, unreadable and readable ways. The first
version of the program was extremely obscure, while this last one is
almost English: <code>print</code> the <code>sum</code> of the <code>range</code> of numbers from <code>1</code>
to <code>10</code>. (We will see in later chapters how to build things like <code>sum</code>
and <code>range</code>.)</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pf3fe04d4c3f6ccc" name="pf3fe04d4c3f6ccc"> ¶ </a>A good programming language helps the programmer by providing a more
abstract way to express himself. It hides uninteresting details,
provides convenient building blocks (such as the <code>while</code> construct),
and, most of the time, allows the programmer to add building blocks
himself (such as the <code>sum</code> and <code>range</code> operations).</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3ec4f0fa1d7306d6" name="p3ec4f0fa1d7306d6"> ¶ </a>JavaScript is the language that is, at the moment, mostly being used
to do all kinds of clever and horrible things with pages on the World
Wide Web. Some <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html">people</a> claim
that the next version of JavaScript will become an important language
for other tasks too. I am unsure whether that will happen, but if you
are interested in programming, JavaScript is definitely a useful
language to learn. Even if you do not end up doing much
web programming, the mind-bending programs I will show you in this
book will always stay with you, haunt you, and influence the programs
you write in other languages.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6ffc7e890b848901" name="p6ffc7e890b848901"> ¶ </a>There are those who will say <em>terrible</em> things about JavaScript. Many
of these things are true. When I was for the first time required to
write something in JavaScript, I quickly came to despise the language.
It would accept almost anything I typed, but interpret it in a way
that was completely different from what I meant. This had a lot to do
with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, but there
is also a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what
it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make
programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it
mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder, because the
system will not point them out to you.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6403e6cf1d6fd4ed" name="p6403e6cf1d6fd4ed"> ¶ </a>However, the flexibility of the language is also an advantage. It
leaves space for a lot of techniques that are impossible in more rigid
languages, and it can be used to overcome some of JavaScript's
shortcomings. After learning it properly, and working with it for a
while, I have really learned to <em>like</em> this language.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5d372a74466674a7" name="p5d372a74466674a7"> ¶ </a>Contrary to what the name suggests, JavaScript has very little to do
with the programming language named Java. The similar name was
inspired by marketing considerations, rather than good judgement. In
1995, when JavaScript was introduced by Netscape, the Java language
was being heavily marketed and gaining in popularity. Apparently,
someone thought it a good idea to try and ride along on this
marketing. Now we are stuck with the name.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p20bc2e21c259965b" name="p20bc2e21c259965b"> ¶ </a>Related to JavaScript is a thing called ECMAScript. When browsers
other than Netscape started to support JavaScript, or something that
looked like it, a document was written to describe precisely how the
language should work. The language described in this document is
called ECMAScript, after the organisation that standardised it.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p223e1f11afa03b89" name="p223e1f11afa03b89"> ¶ </a>ECMAScript describes a general-purpose programming language, and does
not say anything about the integration of this language in an Internet
browser. JavaScript is ECMAScript plus extra tools for dealing with
Internet pages and browser windows.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p680aa5a209e425af" name="p680aa5a209e425af"> ¶ </a>A few other pieces of software use the language described in the
ECMAScript document. Most importantly, the ActionScript language used
by Flash is based on ECMAScript (though it does not precisely follow
the standard). Flash is a system for adding things that move and make
lots of noise to web-pages. Knowing JavaScript won't hurt if you ever
find yourself learning to build Flash movies.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p23572bf9c21cdf90" name="p23572bf9c21cdf90"> ¶ </a>JavaScript is still evolving. Since this book came out, ECMAScript 5
has been released, which is compatible with the version described
here, but adds some of the functionality we will be writing ourselves
as built-in methods. The newest generation of browsers provides this
expanded version of JavaScript. As of 2011, 'ECMAScript harmony', a
more radical extension of the language, is in the process of being
standardised. You should not worry too much about these new versions
making the things you learn from this book obsolete. For one thing,
they will be an extension of the language we have now, so almost
everything written in this book will still hold.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7f13eda01aab2232" name="p7f13eda01aab2232"> ¶ </a>Most chapters in this book contain quite a lot of code<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>. In my
experience, reading and writing code is an important part of learning
to program. Try to not just glance over these examples, but read them
attentively and understand them. This can be slow and confusing at
first, but you will quickly get the hang of it. The same goes for the
exercises. Don't assume you understand them until you've actually
written a working solution.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4eb8d1b48b2bb37b" name="p4eb8d1b48b2bb37b"> ¶ </a>Because of the way the web works, it is always possible to look at the
JavaScript programs that people put in their web-pages. This can be a
good way to learn how some things are done. Because most web
programmers are not 'professional' programmers, or consider JavaScript
programming so uninteresting that they never properly learned it, a
lot of the code you can find like this is of a <em>very</em> bad quality.
When learning from ugly or incorrect code, the ugliness and confusion
will propagate into your own code, so be careful who you learn from.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p42b9dbbc2906fda8" name="p42b9dbbc2906fda8"> ¶ </a>To allow you to try out programs, both the examples and the code you
write yourself, this book makes use of something called a <a name="key2"></a>console.
If you are using a modern graphical browser (Internet Explorer version
6 or higher, Firefox 1.5 or higher, Opera 9 or higher, Safari 3 or
higher, Chrome), the pages in this book will show a blueish bar at the
bottom of your screen. You can open the console by clicking on the
little arrow on the far right of this bar. (Note that I am not talking
about your browser's built-in console.)</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5e7747de8cfc0946" name="p5e7747de8cfc0946"> ¶ </a>The console contains three important elements. There is the output
window, which is used to show error messages and things that programs
print out. Below that, there is a line where you can type in a piece
of JavaScript. Try typing in a number, and pressing the enter key to
run what you typed. If the text you typed produced something
meaningful, it will be shown in the output window. Now try typing
<code>wrong!</code>, and press enter again. The output window will show an error
message. You can use the arrow-up and arrow-down keys to go back to
previous commands that you typed.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p52d9e86c513e6d64" name="p52d9e86c513e6d64"> ¶ </a>For bigger pieces of code, those that span multiple lines and which
you want to keep around for a while, the field on the right can be
used. The 'Run' button is used to execute programs written in this
field. It is possible to have multiple programs open at the same time.
Use the 'New' button to open a new, empty buffer. When there is more
than one open buffer, the menu next to the 'Run' button can be used to
choose which one is being shown. The 'Close' button, as you might
expect, closes a buffer.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p590905737fc41d6e" name="p590905737fc41d6e"> ¶ </a>Example programs in this book always have a small button with an arrow
in their top-right corner, which can be used to run them. The example
we saw earlier looked like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">total</span> = <span class="atom">0</span>, <span class="variable">count</span> = <span class="atom">1</span>;
<span class="keyword">while</span> (<span class="variable">count</span> &lt;= <span class="atom">10</span>) {
  <span class="variable">total</span> += <span class="variable">count</span>;
  <span class="variable">count</span> += <span class="atom">1</span>;
}

used to load the program into the console. Do not hesitate to modify
it and try out the result. The worst that could happen is that you
create an endless loop. An endless loop is what you get when the
condition of the <code>while</code> never becomes false, for example if you
choose to add <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code> to the count variable. Now the
program will run forever.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p11cb94429bfcd757" name="p11cb94429bfcd757"> ¶ </a>Fortunately, browsers keep an eye on the programs running inside them.
Whenever one of them is taking suspiciously long to finish, they will
ask you if you want to cut it off.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p320258aea4902e52" name="p320258aea4902e52"> ¶ </a>In some later chapters, we will build example programs that consist of
many blocks of code. Often, you have to run every one of them for the
program to work. As you may have noticed, the arrow in a block of code
turns purple after the block has been run. When reading a chapter, try
to run every block of code you come across, especially those that
'define' something new (you will see what that means in the next
chapter).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4dfd5650784d1b5a" name="p4dfd5650784d1b5a"> ¶ </a>It is, of course, possible that you can not read a chapter in one
sitting. This means you will have to start halfway when you continue
reading, but if you don't run all the code starting from the top of
the chapter, some things might not work. By holding the shift key
while pressing the 'run' arrow on a block of code, all blocks before
that one will be run as well, so when you start in the middle of a
chapter, hold shift the first time you run a piece of code, and
everything should work as expected.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>'Code' is the substance that programs are made of. Every piece of a

That which is not
data, does not exist. Although all data is in essence just a sequence
of bits<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>, and is thus fundamentally alike, every piece of data plays
its own role. In JavaScript's system, most of this data is neatly
separated into things called <a name="key1"></a>values. Every value has a type, which
determines the kind of role it can play. There are six basic types of
values: Numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and undefined
values.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p50fb86c9d3e2ba37" name="p50fb86c9d3e2ba37"> ¶ </a>To create a value, one must merely invoke its name. This is very
convenient. You don't have to gather building material for your

be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic number of them
at the same time you might run out of computer memory. Fortunately,
this is only a problem if you need them all simultaneously. As soon as
you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind only a
few bits. These bits are recycled to make the next generation of
values.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p50a3479ce6a9dffd" name="p50a3479ce6a9dffd"> ¶ </a>Values of the type <a name="key2"></a>number are, as you might have deduced, numeric

be producing values in less straightforward ways, and it can be useful
to 'try them out' on the console to see what they produce.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6b6235b9080cb806" name="p6b6235b9080cb806"> ¶ </a>This is what <code>144</code> looks like in bits<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>:</p><pre class="preformatted">0100000001100010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p259261911b9e3d68" name="p259261911b9e3d68"> ¶ </a>The number above has 64 bits.

numbers that can be expressed. With three decimal digits, only the
numbers 0 to 999 can be written, which is 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 different
numbers. With 64 binary digits, 2<sup>64</sup> different numbers can be written.
This is a lot, more than 10<sup>19</sup> (a one with nineteen zeroes).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6587537572d2d6de" name="p6587537572d2d6de"> ¶ </a>Not all whole numbers below 10<sup>19</sup> fit in a JavaScript number though.
For one, there are also negative numbers, so one of the bits has to be
used to store the sign of the number. A bigger issue is that non-whole
numbers must also be represented. To do this, 11 bits are used to
store the position of the fractional dot within the number.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7e2d0b7b96040227" name="p7e2d0b7b96040227"> ¶ </a>That leaves 52 bits<a class="footref" href="#footnote3">3</a>. Any whole number less than 2<sup>52</sup> (which is more
than 10<sup>15</sup>) will safely fit in a JavaScript number. In most cases, the
numbers we are using stay well below that, so we do not have to
concern ourselves with bits at all. Which is good. I have nothing in
particular against bits, but you <em>do</em> need a terrible lot of them to
get anything done. When at all possible, it is more pleasant to deal
with bigger things.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2daf3430c67921cb" name="p2daf3430c67921cb"> ¶ </a>Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">9.81</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p63af9617f4b5c93a" name="p63af9617f4b5c93a"> ¶ </a>For very big or very small numbers, one can also use 'scientific'

bits are guaranteed to always be precise. Unfortunately, calculations
with fractional numbers are generally not. The same way that π (pi) can not be
precisely expressed by a finite amount of decimal digits, many numbers
lose some precision when only 64 bits are available to store them.
This is a shame, but it only causes practical problems in very
specific situations. The important thing is to be aware of it, and
treat fractional digital numbers as approximations, not as precise
values.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5e9cbe6e355f31b3" name="p5e9cbe6e355f31b3"> ¶ </a>The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. Arithmetic operations
such as addition or multiplication take two number values and produce
a new number from them. Here is what they look like in JavaScript:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="atom">100</span> + <span class="atom">4</span> * <span class="atom">11</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p42661e965df9439a" name="p42661e965df9439a"> ¶ </a>The <a name="key3"></a><code>+</code> and <a name="key4"></a><code>*</code> symbols are called operators. The first stands for
addition, and the second for multiplication. Putting an operator
between two values will <a name="key5"></a>apply it to those values, and
produce a new value.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p56a1ea0fbf26a539" name="p56a1ea0fbf26a539"> ¶ </a>Does the example mean 'add 4 and 100, and multiply the result by 11',
or is the multiplication done before the adding? As you might have
guessed, the multiplication happens first. But, as in mathematics,
this can be changed by wrapping the addition in parentheses<a name="key6"></a>:</p><pre class="code expression">(<span class="atom">100</span> + <span class="atom">4</span>) * <span class="atom">11</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p50440df750d8329c" name="p50440df750d8329c"> ¶ </a>For subtraction, there is the <a name="key7"></a><code>-</code> operator, and division can be done
with <a name="key8"></a><code>/</code>. When operators appear together without parentheses, the
order in which they are applied is determined by the <a name="key9"></a>precedence of
the operators. The first example shows that multiplication has a
higher precedence than addition. Division and multiplication always
come before subtraction and addition. When multiple operators with the
same precedence appear next to each other (<code>1 - 1 + 1</code>) they are
applied left-to-right.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5ece5e641cb7a91" name="p5ece5e641cb7a91"> ¶ </a>Try to figure out what value this produces, and then run it to see if

When in doubt, just add parentheses.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p37f2f79789db8719" name="p37f2f79789db8719"> ¶ </a>There is one more arithmetic operator which is probably less familiar
to you. The <a name="key10"></a><code>%</code> symbol is used to represent the <a name="key11"></a>remainder operation.
<code>X % Y</code> is the remainder of dividing <code>X</code> by <code>Y</code>. For example
<code>314 % 100</code> is <code>14</code>, <code>10 % 3</code> is <code>1</code>, and <code>144 % 12</code> is <code>0</code>. Remainder
has the same precedence as multiplication and division.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p60f72964a3424f8" name="p60f72964a3424f8"> ¶ </a>The next data type is the <a name="key12"></a>string. Its use is not as evident from its
name as with numbers, but it also fulfills a very basic role. Strings
are used to represent text, the name supposedly derives from the fact
that it strings together a bunch of characters. Strings are written by
enclosing their content in quotes:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;Patch my boat with chewing gum.&quot;</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4b2c38f3da872ec1" name="p4b2c38f3da872ec1"> ¶ </a>Almost anything can be put between double quotes, and JavaScript will
make a string value out of it. But a few characters are tricky. You
can imagine how putting quotes between quotes might be hard. Newlines,
<a name="key13"></a>the things you get when you press enter, can also not be put
between quotes, the string has to stay on a single line.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p66a7f6315b134df3" name="p66a7f6315b134df3"> ¶ </a>To be able to have such characters in a string, the following trick is
used: Whenever a backslash ('<code>\</code>') is found inside quoted text, it
indicates that the character after it has a special meaning. A quote
that is preceded by a backslash will not end the string, but be part
of it. When an '<code>n</code>' character occurs after a backslash, it is
interpreted as a newline. Similarly, a '<code>t</code>' after a backslash means a
tab character<a class="footref" href="#footnote4">4</a>.</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;This is the first line\nAnd this is the second&quot;</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5251dd2fc75a326" name="p5251dd2fc75a326"> ¶ </a>Note that if you type this into the console, it'll display it back in
'source' form, with the quotes and backslash escapes. To see only the
actual text, you can type <code>print(&quot;a\nb&quot;)</code>. What that does precisely
will be clarified a little further on.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3381259269b5ec55" name="p3381259269b5ec55"> ¶ </a>There are of course situations where you want a backslash in a string
to be just a backslash, not a special code. If two backslashes follow
each other, they will collapse right into each other, and only one
will be left in the resulting string value:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;A newline character is written like \&quot;\\n\&quot;.&quot;</span></pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pe7768638750d804" name="pe7768638750d804"> ¶ </a>Strings can not be divided, multiplied, or subtracted.

respectively, 'is greater than' and 'is less than'. They are binary
operators, and the result of applying them is a boolean value that
indicates whether they hold in this case.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1b70e329d23af1ff" name="p1b70e329d23af1ff"> ¶ </a>Strings can be compared in the same way:</p><pre class="code expression"><span class="string">&quot;Aardvark&quot;</span> &lt; <span class="string">&quot;Zoroaster&quot;</span></pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1bc6374d7e3e4694" name="p1bc6374d7e3e4694"> ¶ </a>The way strings are ordered is more or less alphabetic. More or
less... Uppercase letters are always 'less' than lowercase ones, so
<code>&quot;Z&quot; &lt; &quot;a&quot;</code> (upper-case Z, lower-case a) is <code>true</code>, and non-alphabetic
characters ('<code>!</code>', '<code>@</code>', etc) are also included in the ordering. The
actual way in which the comparison is done is based on the <a name="key24"></a>Unicode
standard. This standard assigns a number to virtually every character
one would ever need, including characters from Greek, Arabic,
Japanese, Tamil, and so on. Having such numbers is practical for
storing strings inside a computer ― you can represent them as a list
of numbers. When comparing strings, JavaScript just compares the
numbers of the characters inside the string, from left to right.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1159736b16c0de67" name="p1159736b16c0de67"> ¶ </a>Other similar operators are <a name="key25"></a><code>&gt;=</code> ('is greater than or equal to'),

new values. Creating values like this is an essential part of every
JavaScript program, but it is only a part. A piece of code that
produces a value is called an <a name="key32"></a>expression. Every value that is
written directly (such as <code>22</code> or <code>&quot;psychoanalysis&quot;</code>) is an
expression. An expression between parentheses is also an expression.
And a binary operator applied to two expressions, or a unary operator
applied to one, is also an expression.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p65fc46bd5b67046e" name="p65fc46bd5b67046e"> ¶ </a>There are a few more ways of building expressions, which will be

statements end with a <a name="key34"></a>semicolon (<code>;</code>). The simplest kind of
statement is an expression with a semicolon after it. This is a

a value, but a statement only amounts to something if it somehow
changes the world. It could print something to the screen ― that
counts as changing the world ― or it could change the internal state
of the program in a way that will affect the statements that come
after it. These changes are called '<a name="key35"></a>side effects'. The statements in
the example above just produce the values <code>1</code> and <code>true</code>, and then

starting with the word <code>while</code> creates a <a name="key58"></a>loop. A loop is a
disturbance in the sequence of statements ― it may cause the program to
repeat some statements multiple times. In this case, the word <code>while</code>
is followed by an expression in parentheses (the parentheses are
compulsory here), which is used to determine whether the loop will
loop or finish. As long as the boolean value produced by this

is false, the program goes to the bottom of the loop and continues as
normal.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p12de169b6ad2f5e2" name="p12de169b6ad2f5e2"> ¶ </a>The variable <code>currentNumber</code> demonstrates the way a variable can track
the progress of a program. Every time the loop repeats, it is
incremented by <code>2</code>, and at the beginning of every repetition, it is

in <code>NaN</code>, which is why multiplying it by <code>5</code>, as in the example, still

In my own code, I use <code>+</code> to combine strings and non-strings a lot,

string values. Converting a number to a string is always possible and
straightforward, but converting a string to a number may not even work
(as in the last line of the example). We can use <code>Number</code> to

it first. If converting this value to a boolean would produce <code>true</code>,
it returns this left value, otherwise it returns the one on its
right. Check for yourself that this does the correct thing when the
arguments are booleans. Why does it work like that? It turns out this
is very practical. Consider this example:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">input</span> = <span class="variable">prompt</span>(<span class="string">&quot;What is your name?&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;Kilgore Trout&quot;</span>);

other way without giving a name, the variable <code>input</code> will hold the
value <code>null</code> or <code>&quot;&quot;</code>. Both of these would give <code>false</code> when converted
to a boolean. The expression <code>input || &quot;dear&quot;</code> can in this case be
read as 'the value of the variable <code>input</code>, or else the string
<code>&quot;dear&quot;</code>'. It is an easy way to provide a 'fallback' value.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2c9d338cf8ef8b92" name="p2c9d338cf8ef8b92"> ¶ </a>The <a name="key89"></a><code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator works similarly, but the other way around. When

categories: Programmer mistakes and genuine problems. If someone
forgets to pass a required argument to a function, that is an example
of the first kind of problem. On the other hand, if a program asks the
user to enter a name and it gets back an empty string, that is
something the programmer can not prevent.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p20ee0eeaf72d4de1" name="p20ee0eeaf72d4de1"> ¶ </a>In general, one deals with programmer errors by finding and fixing
them, and with genuine errors by having the code check for them and
perform some suitable action to remedy them (for example, asking for
the name again), or at least fail in a well-defined and clean way.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p265cd385d7c63b7f" name="p265cd385d7c63b7f"> ¶ </a>It is important to decide into which of these categories a certain
problem falls. For example, consider our old <code>power</code> function:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">power</span>(<span class="variabledef">base</span>, <span class="variabledef">exponent</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variabledef">result</span> = <span class="atom">1</span>;

obviously a programmer error, but how about <code>power(9, 0.5)</code>? The
function can not handle fractional exponents, but, mathematically
speaking, raising a number to the halfth power is perfectly reasonable
(<a name="key1"></a><code>Math.pow</code> can handle it). In situations where it is not entirely
clear what kind of input a function accepts, it is often a good idea
to explicitly state the kind of arguments that are acceptable in a

happily continue doing something with it. But the value is wrong, so
whatever it ends up doing with it will also be wrong. And if you are
unlucky, this wrongness only causes a problem after having passed
through twenty other functions. In cases like that, it is extremely
hard to find out where the problem started.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3b2ec371666f4e1a" name="p3b2ec371666f4e1a"> ¶ </a>In some cases, you will be so unconcerned about these problems that
you don't mind the function misbehaving when given incorrect input.
For example, if you know for sure the function will only be called
from a few places, and you can prove that these places give it decent
input, it is generally not worth the trouble to make the function
bigger and uglier so that it can handle problematic cases.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p487f962e97db245e" name="p487f962e97db245e"> ¶ </a>But most of the time, functions that fail 'silently' are hard to use,

whether everything went well? At the moment, it can not tell, except
by re-doing all the work that <code>between</code> did and checking the result of
<code>between</code> with its own result. That is bad. One solution is to make

indicate an error. It does, however, have its downsides. Firstly, what
if the function can already return every possible kind of value? For
example, consider this function that gets the last element from an
array:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">lastElement</span>(<span class="variabledef">array</span>) {

<code>lastElement</code> returns, it is impossible to say.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p59d5d030b1223110" name="p59d5d030b1223110"> ¶ </a>The second issue with returning special values is that it can
sometimes lead to a whole lot of clutter. If a piece of code calls
<code>between</code> ten times, it has to check ten times whether <code>undefined</code> was
returned. Also, if a function calls <code>between</code> but does not have a
strategy to recover from a failure, it will have to check the return
value of <code>between</code>, and if it is <code>undefined</code>, this function can then
return <code>undefined</code> or some other special value to its caller, who in
turn also checks for this value.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2d4a742116a20f7" name="p2d4a742116a20f7"> ¶ </a>Sometimes, when something strange occurs, it would be practical to
just stop doing what we are doing and immediately jump back to a place
that knows how to handle the problem.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p75820b4abd417475" name="p75820b4abd417475"> ¶ </a>Well, we are in luck, a lot of programming languages provide such a
thing. Usually, it is called <a name="key2"></a>exception handling.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p48d4032291a4063d" name="p48d4032291a4063d"> ¶ </a>The theory behind exception handling goes like this: It is possible
for code to <a name="key3"></a>raise (or <a name="key4"></a>throw) an <a name="key5"></a>exception, which is a value.
Raising an exception somewhat resembles a super-charged return from a
function ― it does not just jump out of the current function, but
also out of its callers, all the way up to the top-level call that
started the current execution. This is called <a name="key6"></a>unwinding the stack.
You may remember the <a name="key7"></a>stack of function calls that was mentioned in
<a href="chapter3.html">chapter 3</a>. An exception zooms down this stack, throwing away all
the call contexts it encounters.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p577e309ea04ff91d" name="p577e309ea04ff91d"> ¶ </a>If they always zoomed right down to the base of the stack, exceptions
would not be of much use, they would just provide a novel way to blow
up your program. Fortunately, it is possible to set obstacles for
exceptions along the stack. These '<a name="key8"></a>catch' the exception as it is
zooming down, and can do something with it, after which the program
continues running at the point where the exception was caught.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pd35fda8d169697d" name="pd35fda8d169697d"> ¶ </a>An example:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">lastElement</span>(<span class="variabledef">array</span>) {

executed. The variable named in parentheses after the word <code>catch</code> is
the name given to the exception value inside this block.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2b53d4284ce191bf" name="p2b53d4284ce191bf"> ¶ </a>Note that the function <code>lastElementPlusTen</code> completely ignores the

is part of the argument. When the variable <code>counted</code> reaches seven,
there is no point in continuing to count, but just returning from the
current call to <code>count</code> will not necessarily stop the counting, since
there might be more calls below it. So what we do is just throw a
value, which will cause the control to jump right out of any calls to
<code>count</code>, and land at the <code>catch</code> block.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p770a470bd00d3706" name="p770a470bd00d3706"> ¶ </a>But just returning <code>true</code> in case of an exception is not correct.
Something else might be going wrong, so we first check whether the
exception is the object <code>FoundSeven</code>, created specifically for this
purpose. If it is not, this <code>catch</code> block does not know how to handle
it, so it raises it again.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1040256860b43e79" name="p1040256860b43e79"> ¶ </a>This is a pattern that is also common when dealing with error
conditions ― you have to make sure that your <code>catch</code> block only
handles exceptions that it knows how to handle. Throwing string
values, as some of the examples in this chapter do, is rarely a good
idea, because it makes it hard to recognise the type of the exception.
A better idea is to use unique values, such as the <code>FoundSeven</code>
object, or to introduce a new type of objects, as described in <a href="chapter8.html">chapter 8</a>.</p></div><h1><span class="number">Chapter 6: </span>Functional Programming</h1><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p406bc0550dba7201" name="p406bc0550dba7201"> ¶ </a>As programs get bigger, they also become more complex and harder to
understand. We all think ourselves pretty clever, of course, but we
are mere human beings, and even a moderate amount of chaos tends to
baffle us. And then it all goes downhill. Working on something you do
not really understand is a bit like cutting random wires on those
time-activated bombs they always have in movies. If you are lucky, you
might get the right one ― especially if you are the hero of the movie
and strike a suitably dramatic pose ― but there is always the
possibility of blowing everything up.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p61d9c58b7ccd55b" name="p61d9c58b7ccd55b"> ¶ </a>Admittedly, in most cases, breaking a program does not cause any large
explosions. But when a program, by someone's ignorant tinkering, has
degenerated into a ramshackle mass of errors, reshaping it into
something sensible is a terrible labour ― sometimes you might just as
well start over.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pe323e5622f00be3" name="pe323e5622f00be3"> ¶ </a><a name="key1"></a>Thus, the programmer is always looking for ways to keep
the complexity of his programs as low as possible. An important way to
do this is to try and make code more abstract. When writing a program,
it is easy to get sidetracked into small details at every point. You
come across some little issue, and you deal with it, and then proceed
to the next little problem, and so on. This makes the code read like a
grandmother's tale.</p><blockquote>Yes, dear, to make pea soup you will need split peas, the dry kind.
And you have to soak them at least for a night, or you will have to
cook them for hours and hours. I remember one time, when my dull son
tried to make pea soup. Would you believe he hadn't soaked the peas?
We almost broke our teeth, all of us. Anyway, when you have soaked
the peas, and you'll want about a cup of them per person, and pay
attention because they will expand a bit while they are soaking, so
if you aren't careful they will spill out of whatever you use to
hold them, so also use plenty water to soak in, but as I said, about
a cup of them, when they are dry, and after they are soaked you cook
them in four cups of water per cup of dry peas. Let it simmer for
two hours, which means you cover it and keep it barely cooking, and
then add some diced onions, sliced celery stalk, and maybe a carrot
or two and some ham. Let it all cook for a few minutes more, and it
is ready to eat.</blockquote><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2f9bf5e014dcdc06" name="p2f9bf5e014dcdc06"> ¶ </a>Another way to describe this recipe:</p><blockquote>Per person: one cup dried split peas, half a chopped onion, half a
carrot, a celery stalk, and optionally ham.<br/><br/>Soak peas overnight, simmer them for two hours in four cups of water
(per person), add vegetables and ham, and cook for ten more minutes.</blockquote><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4abdc642ee7bc293" name="p4abdc642ee7bc293"> ¶ </a>This is shorter, but if you don't know how to soak peas you'll surely
screw up and put them in too little water. But how to soak peas can be
looked up, and that is the trick. If you assume a certain basic
knowledge in the audience, you can talk in a language that deals with
bigger concepts, and express things in a much shorter and clearer way.
This, more or less, is what abstraction is.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2bfd98498baedead" name="p2bfd98498baedead"> ¶ </a>How is this far-fetched recipe story relevant to programming? Well,
obviously, the recipe is the program. Furthermore, the basic knowledge
that the cook is supposed to have corresponds to the functions and
other constructs that are available to the programmer. If you remember
the introduction of this book, things like <code>while</code> make it easier to
build loops, and in <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> we wrote some simple functions in order to
make other functions shorter and more straightforward. Such tools,
some of them made available by the language itself, others built by
the programmer, are used to reduce the amount of uninteresting details
in the rest of the program, and thus make that program easier to work
with.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1029fd844bd24fc8" name="p1029fd844bd24fc8"> ¶ </a><a name="key2"></a>Functional programming, which is the subject
of this chapter, produces abstraction through clever ways of combining
functions. A programmer armed with a repertoire of fundamental
functions and, more importantly, the knowledge on how to use them, is
much more effective than one who starts from scratch. Unfortunately, a
standard JavaScript environment comes with deplorably few essential
functions, so we have to write them ourselves or, which is often
preferable, make use of somebody else's code (more on that in
<a href="chapter9.html">chapter 9</a>).</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5b2b16eeb6c201d1" name="p5b2b16eeb6c201d1"> ¶ </a>There are other popular approaches to abstraction, most notably

starting to bother you is the endlessly repeated <code>for</code> loop going over
an array: <code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; something.length; i++) ...</code>. Can this
be abstracted?</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6dce7810233c1f28" name="p6dce7810233c1f28"> ¶ </a>The problem is that, whereas most functions just take some values,
combine them, and return something, such a loop contains a piece of
code that it must execute. It is easy to write a function that goes
over an array and prints out every element:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">printArray</span>(<span class="variabledef">array</span>) {

something' can be represented as a function, and functions are also

you can decompose algorithms into a combination of a few fundamental
algorithms, which are invoked by name, and do not have to be typed out

recluse. Most of the time, he just wandered around his mountain,
talking to trees and laughing with birds. But now and then, when the
pouring rain trapped him in his little hut, and the howling wind made
him feel unbearably small, the recluse felt an urge to write
something, wanted to pour some thoughts out onto paper, where they
could maybe grow bigger than he himself was.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p518bcf1e2791bb49" name="p518bcf1e2791bb49"> ¶ </a>After failing miserably at poetry, fiction, and philosophy, the
recluse finally decided to write a technical book. In his youth, he
had done some computer programming, and he figured that if he could
just write a good book about that, fame and recognition would surely
follow.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4838ad8fb26c0acd" name="p4838ad8fb26c0acd"> ¶ </a>So he wrote. At first he used fragments of tree bark, but that turned
out not to be very practical. He went down to the nearest village and
bought himself a laptop computer. After a few chapters, he realised he
wanted to put the book in HTML format, in order to put it on his
web-page...</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6f89de8af6edd388" name="p6f89de8af6edd388"> ¶ </a>Are you familiar with HTML? It is the method used to add mark-up to
pages on the web, and we will be using it a few times in this book, so
it would be nice if you know how it works, at least generally. If you
are a good student, you could go search the web for a good
introduction to HTML now, and come back here when you have read it.
Most of you probably are lousy students, so I will just give a short
explanation and hope it is enough.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5595eff2a86b5d87" name="p5595eff2a86b5d87"> ¶ </a><a name="key9"></a>HTML stands for 'HyperText Mark-up Language'. An HTML document is
all text. Because it must be able to express the structure of this
text, information about which text is a heading, which text is purple,
and so on, a few characters have a special meaning, somewhat like
backslashes in JavaScript strings. The 'less than' and 'greater than'
characters are used to create '<a name="key10"></a>tags'. A tag gives extra information
about the text in the document. It can stand on its own, for example
to mark the place where a picture should appear in the page, or it can
contain text and other tags, for example when it marks the start and
end of a paragraph.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p28225fb69550a84c" name="p28225fb69550a84c"> ¶ </a>Some tags are compulsory, a whole HTML document must always be

document:</p><pre class="preformatted">&lt;html&gt;

      think/program and the problems and solutions we can imagine
      is very close.  For this reason restricting language

      at best dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

contains information <em>about</em> the document, the second contains the
actual document.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6e09739d3bcd5a53" name="p6e09739d3bcd5a53"> ¶ </a>Most tag names are cryptic abbreviations. <code>h1</code> stands for 'heading 1',
the biggest kind of heading. There are also <code>h2</code> to <code>h6</code> for
successively smaller headings. <code>p</code> means 'paragraph', and <code>img</code> stands
for 'image'. The <code>img</code> element does not contain any text or other
tags, but it does have some extra information,

not be written directly in the text of the document. If you want to

where '<code>lt</code>' stands for 'less than'. '<code>&amp;gt;</code>' is used for '<code>&gt;</code>', and
because these codes also give the ampersand character a special

manuscript, but typing all those less-than and greater-than signs made
his fingers hurt, and he constantly forgot to write <code>&amp;amp;</code> when he
needed an <code>&amp;</code>. This gave him a headache. Next, he tried to write the
book in Microsoft Word, and then save it as HTML. But the HTML that
came out of that was fifteen times bigger and more complicated than it
had to be. And besides, Microsoft Word gave him a headache.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1156d30627166a36" name="p1156d30627166a36"> ¶ </a>The solution that he eventually came up with was this: He would write
the book as plain text, following some simple rules about the way
paragraphs were separated and the way headings looked. Then, he would
write a program to convert this text into precisely the HTML that he
wanted.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p231e5049ecd8f592" name="p231e5049ecd8f592"> ¶ </a>The rules are this:</p><ol><li>Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.</li><li>A paragraph that starts with a '%' symbol is a header.

could recover the following file:</p><pre class="preformatted">% The Book of Programming

%% The Two Aspects

Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,
it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The
essence stays invisibly below.

When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the
memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.

The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called
Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is
called Data.

Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control
consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult
tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.

The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control
proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the
other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
Data and Control.

Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers
of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,
the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
Control was restricted into control structures and functions.

%% Short Sayings

When a student asked Fu-Tzu about the nature of the cycle of Data and
Control, Fu-Tzu replied 'Think of a compiler, compiling itself.'

A student asked 'The programmers of old used only simple machines and
no programming languages, yet they made beautiful programs. Why do we
use complicated machines and programming languages?'. Fu-Tzu replied
'The builders of old used only sticks and clay, yet they made
beautiful huts.'

A hermit spent ten years writing a program. 'My program can compute
the motion of the stars on a 286-computer running MS DOS', he proudly
announced. 'Nobody owns a 286-computer or uses MS DOS anymore.',
Fu-Tzu responded.

Fu-Tzu had written a small program that was full of global state and
dubious shortcuts. Reading it, a student asked 'You warned us against
these techniques, yet I find them in your program. How can this be?'
Fu-Tzu said 'There is no need to fetch a water hose when the house is
not on fire.'{This is not to be read as an encouragement of sloppy
programming, but rather as a warning against neurotic adherence to
rules of thumb.}

%% Wisdom

A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I take the root
of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'.
Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed. 'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down
the precise value of the square root of two for me.'

Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength
is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code
is needed.'

Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest
programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting
comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is almost a *million* lines
already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'
Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,
frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a
difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit
him on the back of his head and shouted '*Type something!*' The student
started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly
understood the beautiful solution.

%% Progression

A beginning programmer writes his programs like an ant builds her
hill, one piece at a time, without thought for the bigger structure.
His programs will be like loose sand. They may stand for a while, but
growing too big they fall apart{Referring to the danger of internal
inconsistency and duplicated structure in unorganised code.}.

Realising this problem, the programmer will start to spend a lot of
time thinking about structure. His programs will be rigidly
structured, like rock sculptures. They are solid, but when they must
change, violence must be done to them{Referring to the fact that
structure tends to put restrictions on the evolution of a program.}.

The master programmer knows when to apply structure and when to leave
things in their simple form. His programs are like clay, solid yet
malleable.

%% Language

When a programming language is created, it is given syntax and
semantics. The syntax describes the form of the program, the semantics
describe the function. When the syntax is beautiful and the semantics
are clear, the program will be like a stately tree. When the syntax is
clumsy and the semantics confusing, the program will be like a bramble
bush.

Tzu-ssu was asked to write a program in the language called Java,
which takes a very primitive approach to functions. Every morning, as
he sat down in front of his computer, he started complaining. All day
he cursed, blaming the language for all that went wrong. Fu-Tzu
listened for a while, and then reproached him, saying 'Every language
has its own way. Follow its form, do not try to program as if you
were using another language.'</pre></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p897b23e06210d6e" name="p897b23e06210d6e"> ¶ </a>To honour the memory of our good recluse, I would like to finish his

we have been at that place already. It could look like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">member</span>(<span class="variabledef">array</span>, <span class="variabledef">value</span>) {

program because it takes too long to finish, we have to stop our
amateurish attempts and implement a serious algorithm. A lot of work
has gone into problems like this in the past, and many solutions have
been designed (some brilliant, others useless). A very popular and
efficient one is called <a name="key12"></a>A* (pronounced A-star). We will spend the
rest of the chapter implementing an A* route-finding function for our
map.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3f39b88a3fe7ae6c" name="p3f39b88a3fe7ae6c"> ¶ </a>Before I get to the algorithm itself, let me tell you a bit more about
the problem it solves. The trouble with searching routes through
graphs is that, in big graphs, there are an awful lot of them. Our
Hiva Oa path-finder showed that, when the graph is small, all we needed
to do was to make sure our paths didn't revisit points they had
already passed. On our new map, this is not enough anymore.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p52128e90b57b21e9" name="p52128e90b57b21e9"> ¶ </a>The fundamental problem is that there is too much room for going in
the wrong direction. Unless we somehow manage to steer our exploration
of paths towards the goal, a choice we make for continuing a given
path is more likely to go in the wrong direction than in the right
direction. If you keep generating paths like that, you end up with an
enormous amount of paths, and even if one of them accidentally reaches
the end point, you do not know whether that is the shortest path.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p19b4c229e6854121" name="p19b4c229e6854121"> ¶ </a>So what you want to do is explore directions that are likely to get
you to the end point first. On a grid like our map, you can get a
rough estimate of how good a path is by checking how long it is and
how close its end is to the end point. By adding path length and an
estimate of the distance it still has to go, you can get a rough idea
of which paths are promising. If you extend promising paths first, you
are less likely to waste time on useless ones.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p605aef04ef4aade7" name="p605aef04ef4aade7"> ¶ </a>But that still is not enough. If our map was of a perfectly flat
plane, the path that looked promising would almost always be the best
one, and we could use the above method to walk right to our goal. But
we have valleys and hillsides blocking our paths, so it is hard to
tell in advance which direction will be the most efficient path.
Because of this, we still end up having to explore way too many paths.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7e13f30083397647" name="p7e13f30083397647"> ¶ </a>To correct this, we can make clever use of the fact that we are
constantly exploring the most promising path first. Once we have
determined that path A is the best way to get to point X, we can
remember that. When, later on, path B also gets to point X, we know
that it is not the best route, so we do not have to explore it
further. This can prevent our program from building a lot of pointless
paths.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4933e09f45bed7ec" name="p4933e09f45bed7ec"> ¶ </a>The algorithm, then, goes something like this...</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7429b315086105d4" name="p7429b315086105d4"> ¶ </a>There are two pieces of data to keep track of. The first one is called
the open list, it contains the partial routes that must still be
explored. Each route has a score, which is calculated by adding its
length to its estimated distance from the goal. This estimate must
always be optimistic, it should never overestimate the distance. The
second is a set of nodes that we have seen, together with the shortest
partial route that got us there. This one we will call the reached
list. We start by adding a route that contains only the starting node
to the open list, and recording it in the reached list.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p54f2f4829fa45297" name="p54f2f4829fa45297"> ¶ </a>Then, as long as there are any nodes in the open list, we take out the
one that has the lowest (best) score, and find the ways in which it
can be continued (by calling <code>possibleDirections</code>). For each of the
nodes this returns, we create a new route by appending it to our
original route, and adjusting the length of the route using
<code>weightedDistance</code>. The endpoint of each of these new routes is then
looked up in the reached list.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p225b77195287d4ca" name="p225b77195287d4ca"> ¶ </a>If the node is not in the reached list yet, it means we have not seen
it before, and we add the new route to the open list and record it in
the reached list. If we <em>had</em> seen it before, we compare the score of
the new route to the score of the route in the reached list. If the
new route is shorter, we replace the existing route with the new one.
Otherwise, we discard the new route, since we have already seen a
better way to get to that point.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p15f21832c000f5e4" name="p15f21832c000f5e4"> ¶ </a>We continue doing this until the route we fetch from the open list
ends at the goal node, in which case we have found our route, or until
the open list is empty, in which case we have found out that there is
no route. In our case the map contains no unsurmountable obstacles, so
there is always a route.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6e3b0a4bdd0b7c01" name="p6e3b0a4bdd0b7c01"> ¶ </a>How do we know that the first full route that we get from the open
list is also the shortest one? This is a result of the fact that we
only look at a route when it has the lowest score. The score of a
route is its actual length plus an <em>optimistic</em> estimate of the
remaining length. This means that if a route has the lowest score in
the open list, it is always the best route to its current endpoint ―
it is impossible for another route to later find a better way to that
point, because if it were better, its score would have been lower.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p14edd10217b17d31" name="p14edd10217b17d31"> ¶ </a>Try not to get frustrated when the fine points of why this works are
still eluding you. When thinking about algorithms like this, having
seen 'something like it' before helps a lot, it gives you a point of
reference to compare the approach to. Beginning programmers have to do
without such a point of reference, which makes it rather easy to get
lost. Just realise that this is advanced stuff, globally read over the
rest of the chapter, and come back to it later when you feel like a
challenge.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3adb16bcddeec555" name="p3adb16bcddeec555"> ¶ </a>I am afraid that, for one aspect of the algorithm, I'm going to have
to invoke magic again. The open list needs to be able to hold a large
amount of routes, and to quickly find the route with the lowest score
among them. Storing them in a normal array, and searching through this
array every time, is way too slow, so I give you a data structure
called a <a name="key13"></a>binary heap. You create them with <code>new</code>, just like <code>Date</code>
objects, giving them a function that is used to 'score' its elements
as argument. The resulting object has the methods <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>,

effect. The Hiva Oa algorithm used arrays of locations to store
routes, and copied them with the <code>concat</code> method when it extended
them. This time, we can not afford to copy arrays, since we will be
exploring lots and lots of routes. Instead, we use a 'chain' of
objects to store a route. Every object in the chain has some
properties, such as a point on the map, and the length of the route so
far, and it also has a property that points at the previous object in
the chain. Something like this:</p><div class="illustration"><img src="img/objectchain.png"/></div><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2c8aee6703ed2618" name="p2c8aee6703ed2618"> ¶ </a>Where the cyan circles are the relevant objects, and the lines

used to build a new route, which continues from <code>A</code>. It has a
property, which we will call <code>from</code>, pointing at the route it is based
on. When we need to reconstruct a route later, we can follow these
properties to find all the points that the route passed. Note that
object <code>B</code> is part of two routes, one that ends in <code>D</code> and one that
ends in <code>E</code>. When there are a lot of routes, this can save us much
storage space ― every new route only needs one new object for itself,
the rest is shared with other routes that started the same way.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><a name="exercise5"></a><div class="exercisenum">Ex. 7.5</div><div class="exercise"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7a25220698e3520" name="p7a25220698e3520"> ¶ </a>Write a function <code>estimatedDistance</code> that gives an optimistic estimate

us to the goal point. If it does not, we must continue by expanding
it. This is what the <code>forEach</code> takes care of. It looks up this new
point in the reached list. If it is not found there, or the node found

(if any) is removed from the open list.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3f08d59ab6d9538c" name="p3f08d59ab6d9538c"> ¶ </a>What if the route in <code>known</code> is not on the open list? It has to be,
because routes are only removed from the open list when they have been

stirred up the software industry. Most of the ideas behind it were not
really new at the time, but they had finally gained enough momentum to
start rolling, to become fashionable. Books were being written,
courses given, programming languages developed. All of a sudden,
everybody was extolling the virtues of object-orientation,
enthusiastically applying it to every problem, convincing themselves
they had finally found the <em>right way to write programs</em>.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4a5356a6d996e9b9" name="p4a5356a6d996e9b9"> ¶ </a>These things happen a lot. When a process is hard and confusing,
people are always on the lookout for a magic solution. When something
looking like such a solution presents itself, they are prepared to
become devoted followers. For many programmers, even today,
object-orientation (or their view of it) is the gospel. When a program
is not 'truly object-oriented', whatever that means, it is considered
decidedly inferior.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4a5e752e289a65b1" name="p4a5e752e289a65b1"> ¶ </a>Few fads have managed to stay popular for as long as this one, though.
Object-orientation's longevity can largely be explained by the fact
that the ideas at its core are very solid and useful. In this chapter,
we will discuss these ideas, along with JavaScript's (rather
eccentric) take on them. The above paragraphs are by no means meant to
discredit these ideas. What I want to do is warn the reader against
developing an unhealthy attachment to them.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5d07c4f5109e7992" name="p5d07c4f5109e7992"> ¶ </a>As the name suggests, object-oriented programming is related to
objects. So far, we have used objects as loose aggregations of values,
adding and altering their properties whenever we saw fit. In an
object-oriented approach, objects are viewed as little worlds of their
own, and the outside world may touch them only through a limited and
well-defined <a name="key2"></a>interface, a number of specific methods and properties.
The 'reached list' we used at the end of <a href="chapter7.html">chapter 7</a> is an example of
this: We used only three functions, <code>makeReachedList</code>, <code>storeReached</code>,
and <code>findReached</code> to interact with it. These three functions form an

some properties, such as <code>toString</code>, are 'hidden', and do not show up
when going over properties with <code>for</code>/<code>in</code>. It turns out that browsers
in the Gecko family (Firefox, most importantly) give every object a
hidden property named <code>__proto__</code>, which points to the prototype of
that object. <code>hasOwnProperty</code> will return <code>true</code> for this one, even
though the program did not explicitly add it. Having access to the
prototype of an object can be very convenient, but making it a
property like that was not a very good idea. Still, Firefox is a
widely used browser, so when you write a program for the web you have
to be careful with this. There is a method <a name="key17"></a><code>propertyIsEnumerable</code>,

detail, and when you are using <code>Dictionary</code> objects you do not need to
directly use it.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p54a4aa38e7a80eab" name="p54a4aa38e7a80eab"> ¶ </a>Whenever you write an interface, it is a good idea to add a comment

wants to work with the interface, they can quickly see how to use it,
and do not have to study the whole program.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2aaba1b065516c82" name="p2aaba1b065516c82"> ¶ </a>Most of the time, when you are designing an interface, you will soon
find some limitations and problems in whatever you came up with, and
change it. To prevent wasting your time, it is advisable to document
your interfaces only <em>after</em> they have been used in a few real
situations and proven themselves to be practical. ― Of course, this
might make it tempting to forget about documentation altogether.
Personally, I treat writing documentation as a 'finishing touch' to
add to a system. When it feels ready, it is time to write something
about it, and to see if it sounds as good in English (or whatever
language) as it does in JavaScript (or whatever programming language).</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p588adda0b0472459" name="p588adda0b0472459"> ¶ </a>The distinction between the external interface of an object and its
internal details is important for two reasons. Firstly, having a
small, clearly described interface makes an object easier to use. You
only have to keep the interface in mind, and do not have to worry
about the rest unless you are changing the object itself.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p56d8406fdc34ca54" name="p56d8406fdc34ca54"> ¶ </a>Secondly, it often turns out to be necessary or practical to change
something about the internal implementation of an object type<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>, to
make it more efficient, for example, or to fix some problem. When
outside code is accessing every single property and detail in the
object, you can not change any of them without also updating a lot of
other code. If outside code only uses a small interface, you can do
what you want, as long as you do not change the interface.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p639a46444303f2d0" name="p639a46444303f2d0"> ¶ </a>Some people go very far in this. They will, for example, never include
properties in the interface of object, only methods ― if their object
type has a length, it will be accessible with the <code>getLength</code> method,
not the <code>length</code> property. This way, if they ever want to change their
object in such a way that it no longer has a <code>length</code> property, for
example because it now has some internal array whose length it must
return, they can update the function without changing the interface.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p44dc075d8a2b8573" name="p44dc075d8a2b8573"> ¶ </a>My own take is that in most cases this is not worth it. Adding a
<code>getLength</code> method which only contains <code>return this.length;</code> mostly
just adds meaningless code, and, in most situations, I consider
meaningless code a bigger problem than the risk of having to
occasionally change the interface to my objects.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5e2f0cee5f85da20" name="p5e2f0cee5f85da20"> ¶ </a>Adding new methods to existing prototypes can be very convenient.

wrote in <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> a method on strings.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p584b92a939af8ba8" name="p584b92a939af8ba8"> ¶ </a>However, if your program has to run on the same web-page as another
program (either written by you or by someone else) which uses
<code>for</code>/<code>in</code> naively ― the way we have been using it so far ― then
adding things to prototypes, especially the <code>Object</code> and <code>Array</code>
prototype, will definitely break something, because these loops will
suddenly start seeing those new properties. For this reason, some
people prefer not to touch these prototypes at all. Of course, if you
are careful, and you do not expect your code to have to coexist with
badly-written code, adding methods to standard prototypes is a
perfectly good technique.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3e80b90220c891b9" name="p3e80b90220c891b9"> ¶ </a>In this chapter we are going to build a virtual terrarium, a tank with
insects moving around in it. There will be some objects involved (this
is, after all, the chapter on object-oriented programming). We will
take a rather simple approach, and make the terrarium a
two-dimensional grid, like the second map in <a href="chapter7.html">chapter 7</a>. On this grid
there are a number of bugs. When the terrarium is active, all the bugs
get a chance to take an action, such as moving, every half second.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2ac546ad345b5e63" name="p2ac546ad345b5e63"> ¶ </a>Thus, we chop both time and space into units with a fixed size ―

important to keep the amount of methods and responsibilities that an

the eight directions, it contains a property. The property indicating

to work with objects that have a certain interface, any kind of object
that happens to support this interface can be plugged into the code,
and it will just work. We already saw simple examples of this, like
the <code>toString</code> method on objects. All objects that have a meaningful
<code>toString</code> method can be given to <code>print</code> and other functions that
need to convert values to strings, and the correct string will be
produced, no matter how their <code>toString</code> method chooses to build this
string.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1fc9c932dbf032c2" name="p1fc9c932dbf032c2"> ¶ </a>Similarly, <code>forEach</code> works on both real arrays and the pseudo-arrays

of the array.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p758d80d940318015" name="p758d80d940318015"> ¶ </a>To make life in the terrarium more life-like, we will add to it the

reproduce<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>, generating a new creature of the same kind.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p42c42d12dc3c248" name="p42c42d12dc3c248"> ¶ </a>If there are only bugs, wasting energy by moving around and eating
each other, a terrarium will soon succumb to the forces of entropy,
run out of energy, and become a lifeless wasteland. To prevent this
from happening (too quickly, at least), we add lichen to the
terrarium. Lichen do not move, they just use photo-synthesis to
gather energy, and reproduce.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p67d47ddc7a971734" name="p67d47ddc7a971734"> ¶ </a>To make this work, we will need a terrarium with a different

for them, because their food moves around so much it is rare to find

lichen are abundant, which causes a lot of eaters to be born, which

which causes the lichen to become abundant, and so on. You could try
to make the lichen-eater-eaters 'hibernate' (use the <code>&quot;wait&quot;</code> action
for a while), when they fail to find food for a few turns. If you
choose the right amount of turns for this hibernation, or have them
wake up automatically when they smell lots of food, this could be a
good strategy.</p></div></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p436c3a722d3cad23" name="p436c3a722d3cad23"> ¶ </a>That concludes our discussion of terraria. The rest of the chapter is

be heard having lengthy, subtle discussions about correct and
incorrect uses of inheritance. It is important to bear in mind that
inheritance, in the end, is just a trick that allows lazy<a class="footref" href="#footnote3">3</a>
programmers to write less code. Thus, the question of whether
inheritance is being used correctly boils down to the question of
whether the resulting code works correctly and avoids useless
repetitions. Still, the principles used by these students provide a
good way to start thinking about inheritance.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p32881e0715c30db" name="p32881e0715c30db"> ¶ </a>Inheritance is the creation of a new type of objects, the
'<a name="key30"></a>sub-type', based on an existing type, the '<a name="key31"></a>super-type'. The
sub-type starts with all the properties and methods of the super-type,
it inherits them, and then modifies a few of these, and optionally
adds new ones. Inheritance is best used when the thing modelled by the
sub-type can be said to <em>be</em> an object of the super-type.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1dec7ccc2bddffe4" name="p1dec7ccc2bddffe4"> ¶ </a>Thus, a <code>Piano</code> type could be a sub-type of an <code>Instrument</code> type,
because a piano <em>is</em> an instrument. Because a piano has a whole array
of keys, one might be tempted to make <code>Piano</code> a sub-type of <code>Array</code>,
but a piano <em>is</em> no array, and implementing it like that is bound to
lead to all kinds of silliness. For example, a piano also has pedals.
Why would <code>piano[0]</code> give me the first key, and not the first pedal?
The situation is, of course, that a piano <em>has</em> keys, so it would be
better to give it a property <code>keys</code>, and possibly another property
<code>pedals</code>, both holding arrays.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6a1c7c2b75c953a7" name="p6a1c7c2b75c953a7"> ¶ </a>It is possible for a sub-type to be the super-type of yet another
sub-type. Some problems are best solved by building a complex family
tree of types. You have to take care not to get too inheritance-happy,
though. Overuse of inheritance is a great way to make a program into a
big ugly mess.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p644bfcb5a2a20d3e" name="p644bfcb5a2a20d3e"> ¶ </a>The working of the <code>new</code> keyword and the <code>prototype</code> property of
constructors suggest a certain way of using objects. For simple
objects, such as the terrarium-creatures, this way works rather well.
Unfortunately, when a program starts to make serious use of
inheritance, this approach to objects quickly becomes clumsy. Adding
some functions to take care of common operations can make things a
little smoother. Many people define, for example, <code>inherit</code> and
<code>method</code> methods on objects.</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">Object</span>.<span class="property">prototype</span>.<span class="property">inherit</span> = <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="variabledef">baseConstructor</span>) {

not use a <code>script</code> tag (<code>load</code> internally creates and adds such a
tag), but to fetch the content of the file directly (see <a href="chapter14.html">chapter 14</a>), and
then use the <code>eval</code> function to execute it. This makes script loading
instantaneous, and thus easier to deal with.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p64d1d3a066b53092" name="p64d1d3a066b53092"> ¶ </a><a name="key4"></a><code>eval</code>, short for 'evaluate', is an interesting function. You give

amount of available libraries is not very large.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p28730aa17f362171" name="p28730aa17f362171"> ¶ </a>But recently this seems to be improving. There are a number of good
libraries with 'basic' tools, things like <code>map</code> and <code>clone</code>. Other
languages tend to provide such obviously useful things as built-in
standard features, but with JavaScript you'll have to either build a
collection of them for yourself or use a library. Using a library is
recommended: It is less work, and the code in a library has usually
been tested more thoroughly than the things you wrote yourself.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p40fe3f5a106dc4ec" name="p40fe3f5a106dc4ec"> ¶ </a>Covering these basics, there are (among others) the 'lightweight'
libraries <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">prototype</a>, <a href="http://mootools.net">mootools</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://mochikit.com">MochiKit</a>. There are also some larger 'frameworks'
available, which do a lot more than just provide a set of basic tools.
<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> (by Yahoo), and <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> seem to be the most popular ones in that
genre. All of these can be downloaded and used free of charge. My
personal favourite is MochiKit, but this is mostly a matter of taste.
When you get serious about JavaScript programming, it is a good idea
to quickly glance through the documentation of each of these, to get a
general idea about the way they work and the things they provide.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p46d01329ecc618f" name="p46d01329ecc618f"> ¶ </a>The fact that a basic toolkit is almost indispensable for any
non-trivial JavaScript programs, combined with the fact that there are
so many different toolkits, causes a bit of a dilemma for library
writers. You either have to make your library depend on one of the
toolkits, or write the basic tools yourself and include them with the
library. The first option makes the library hard to use for people who
are using a different toolkit, and the second option adds a lot of
non-essential code to the library. This dilemma might be one of the
reasons why there are relatively few good, widely used JavaScript
libraries. It is possible that, in the future, new versions of
ECMAScript and changes in browsers will make toolkits less necessary,
and thus (partially) solve this problem.</p></div><h1><span class="number">Chapter 10: </span>Regular Expressions</h1><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p64ff0b30104c964c" name="p64ff0b30104c964c"> ¶ </a>At various points in the previous chapters, we had to look for
patterns in string values. In <a href="chapter4.html">chapter 4</a> we extracted date values from
strings by writing out the precise positions at which the numbers that
were part of the date could be found. Later, in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>, we saw some
particularly ugly pieces of code for finding certain types of
characters in a string, for example the characters that had to be
escaped in HTML output.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4907100ef57e381c" name="p4907100ef57e381c"> ¶ </a><a name="key1"></a>Regular expressions are a language for describing
patterns in strings. They form a small, separate language, which is
embedded inside JavaScript (and in various other programming
languages, in one way or another). It is not a very readable language
― big regular expressions tend to be completely unreadable. But, it
is a useful tool, and can really simplify string-processing programs.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p213ad6cd9cbc5562" name="p213ad6cd9cbc5562"> ¶ </a>Just like strings get written between quotes, regular expression

regular expression instead of a string. Patterns specified by regular
expressions can do a few things that strings can not do. For a start,
they allow some of their elements to match more than a single
character. In <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>, when extracting mark-up from a document, we
needed to find the first asterisk or opening brace in a string. That
could be done like this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">asteriskOrBrace</span> = <span class="string">/[\{\*]/</span>;

expression. They can enclose a set of characters, and they mean 'any
of these characters'. Most non-alphanumeric characters have some
special meaning inside a regular expression, so it is a good idea to

(<code>\w</code>) matches any alphanumeric character (including underscores, for
some reason), and an escaped 's' (<code>\s</code>) matches any white-space (tab,

be at least a little familiar with the World Wide Web. This

elements that make the web work, and the way they relate to
JavaScript. The three after this one are more practical, and show some
of the ways JavaScript can be used to inspect and change a web-page.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p974cad8a7797534" name="p974cad8a7797534"> ¶ </a>The Internet is, basically, just a computer network spanning most of
the world. Computer networks make it possible for computers to send
each other messages. The techniques that underlie networking are an
interesting subject, but not the subject of this book. All you have to
know is that, typically, one computer, which we will call the
<a name="key1"></a>server, is waiting for other computers to start talking to it. Once
another computer, the <a name="key2"></a>client, opens communications with this server,
they will exchange whatever it is that needs to be exchanged using
some specific language, a <a name="key3"></a>protocol.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p37853189e1adc3cf" name="p37853189e1adc3cf"> ¶ </a>The Internet is used to carry messages for <em>many</em> different protocols.
There are protocols for chatting, protocols for file sharing,
protocols used by malicious software to control the computer of the
poor schmuck who installed it, and so on. The protocol that is of
interest to us is that used by the World Wide Web. It is called
<a name="key4"></a>HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, and is used to
retrieve web-pages and the files associated with them.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2902c9e4e783994d" name="p2902c9e4e783994d"> ¶ </a>In HTTP communication, the server is the computer on which the
web-page is stored. The client is the computer, such as yours, which
asks the server for a page, so that it can display it. Asking for a
page like this is called an '<a name="key5"></a>HTTP request'.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1338349ab05e601b" name="p1338349ab05e601b"> ¶ </a>Web-pages and other files that are accessible through the Internet are
identified by <a name="key6"></a>URLs, which is an abbreviation of Universal Resource
Locators. A URL looks like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4d943105a436c077" name="p4d943105a436c077"> ¶ </a>It is composed of three parts. The start, <code>http://</code>, indicates that
this URL uses the HTTP protocol. There are some other protocols, such
as FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which also make use of URLs. The next
part, <code>acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu</code>, names the server on which this
page can be found. The end of the URL,
<code>/~phalsal/texts/taote-v3.html</code>, names a specific file on this server.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p21770142dde6d5af" name="p21770142dde6d5af"> ¶ </a>Most of the time, the World Wide Web is accessed using a browser.
After typing a URL or clicking a link, the browser makes the
appropriate HTTP request to the appropriate server. If all goes well,
the server responds by sending a file back to the browser, who shows
it to the user in one way or another.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p647f98273ef611ea" name="p647f98273ef611ea"> ¶ </a>When, as in the example, the retrieved file is an <a name="key7"></a>HTML document, it
will be displayed as a web-page. We briefly discussed HTML in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>,
where we saw that it could refer to image files. In <a href="chapter9.html">chapter 9</a>, we
found that HTML pages can also contain <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to load files
of JavaScript code. When showing an HTML document, a browser will
fetch all these extra files from their servers, so it can add them to
the document.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1b80e87a36e47799" name="p1b80e87a36e47799"> ¶ </a>Although a URL is supposed to point at a file, it is possible for a
web-server to do something more complicated than just looking up a
file and sending it to the client. ― It can process this file in some
way first, or maybe there is no file at all, but only a program that,
given a URL, has some way of generating the relevant document for it.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4a034a06d0f4a6e4" name="p4a034a06d0f4a6e4"> ¶ </a>Programs that transform or generate documents on a server are a
popular way to make web-pages less static. When a file is just a file,
it is always the same, but when there is a program that builds it
every time it is requested, it could be made to look different for
each person, based on things like whether this person has logged in or
specified certain preferences. This can also make managing the content
of web-pages much easier ― instead of adding a new HTML file whenever
something new is put on a website, a new document is added to some
central storage, and the program knows where to find it and how to
show it to clients.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5427df345f8f4442" name="p5427df345f8f4442"> ¶ </a>This kind of web programming is called <a name="key8"></a>server-side programming. It
affects the document before it is sent to the user. In some cases, it
is also practical to have a program that runs <em>after</em> the page has
been sent, when the user is looking at it. This is called <a name="key9"></a>client-side
programming, because the program runs on the client computer.
Client-side web programming is what JavaScript was invented for.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#pb5d4950c3451eeb" name="pb5d4950c3451eeb"> ¶ </a>Running programs client-side has an inherent problem. You can never
really know in advance what kinds of programs the page you are
visiting is going to run. If it can send information from your
computer to others, damage something, or infiltrate your system,
surfing the web would be a rather hazardous activity.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p2ca07b9de2aadd9b" name="p2ca07b9de2aadd9b"> ¶ </a>To solve this dilemma, browsers severely limit the things a JavaScript
program may do. It is not allowed to look at your files, or to modify
anything not related to the web-page it came with. Isolating a
programming environment like this is called <a name="key10"></a>sand-boxing. Allowing
the programs enough room to be useful, and at the same time
restricting them enough to prevent them from doing harm is not an easy
thing to do. Every few months, some JavaScript programmer comes up
with a new way to circumvent the limitations and do something harmful
or privacy-invading. The people responsible for the browsers respond
by modifying their programs to make this trick impossible, and all is
well again ― until the next problem is discovered.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p75491f3ca449564a" name="p75491f3ca449564a"> ¶ </a>One of the first JavaScript tricks that became widely used is the
<a name="key11"></a><a name="key12"></a><code>open</code> method of the <code>window</code> object. It takes a URL
as an argument, and will open a new window showing that URL.</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">perry</span> = <span class="variable">window</span>.<span class="property">open</span>(<span class="string">&quot;http://www.pbfcomics.com&quot;</span>);</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p66fb209b064e4e6a" name="p66fb209b064e4e6a"> ¶ </a>Unless you turned off pop-up blocking in <a href="chapter6.html">chapter 6</a>, there's a chance that
this new window is blocked. There is a good reason pop-up blockers
exist. Web-programmers, especially those trying to get people to pay
attention to advertisements, have abused the poor <code>window.open</code> method
so much that by now, most users hate it with a passion. It has its
place though, and in this book we will be using it to show some
example pages. As a general rule, your scripts should not open any new
windows unless the user asked for them.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p21aa8dc65094ea6a" name="p21aa8dc65094ea6a"> ¶ </a>Note that, because <code>open</code> (just like <code>setTimeout</code> and company) is a
method on the <code>window</code> object, the <code>window.</code> part can be left off.
When a function is called 'normally', it is called as a method on the
top-level object, which is what <code>window</code> is. Personally, I think
<code>open</code> sounds a bit generic, so I'll usually type <code>window.open</code>, which
makes it clear that it is a window that is being opened.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7f5e5857b8aa51fc" name="p7f5e5857b8aa51fc"> ¶ </a>The value returned by <code>window.open</code> is a new window. This is the
global object for the script running in that window, and contains all
the standard things like the <code>Object</code> constructor and the <code>Math</code>
object. But if you try to look at them, most browsers will (probably)
not let you...</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="variable">show</span>(<span class="variable">perry</span>.<span class="property">Math</span>);</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4d7cf06c6a768e11" name="p4d7cf06c6a768e11"> ¶ </a>This is part of the sand-boxing that I mentioned earlier. Pages opened
by your browser might show information that is meant only for you, for
example on sites where you logged in, and thus it would be bad if any
random script could go and read them. The exception to this rule is
pages opened on the same domain: When a script running on a page from
<code>eloquentjavascript.net</code> opens another page on that same domain, it
can do everything it wants to this page.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p5be60148df827603" name="p5be60148df827603"> ¶ </a>An opened window can be closed with its <a name="key13"></a><a name="key14"></a><code>close</code>

(documents-within-a-document), are also windows from the perspective
of a JavaScript program, and have their own JavaScript environment. In
fact, the environment that you have access to in the console belongs
to a small invisible frame hidden somewhere on this page ― this way,
it is slightly harder for you to accidentally mess up the whole page.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p610a3520542c16c7" name="p610a3520542c16c7"> ¶ </a>Every window object has a <a name="key15"></a><code>document</code> property, which contains an
object representing the document shown in that window. This object

given a string argument, writes some HTML to the document. When it is
used on a fully loaded document, it will replace the whole document by
the given HTML, which is usually not what you want. The idea is to
have a script call it while the document is being loaded, in which
case the written HTML will be inserted into the document at the place
of the <code>script</code> tag that triggered it. This is a simple way to add
some dynamic elements to a page. For example, here is a trivially

not really a passive file, but a server-side program, it can become
useful to include information other than a filename in the request.
For this purpose, HTTP requests are allowed to contain additional
'parameters'. Here is an example:</p><pre class="preformatted">http://www.google.com/search?q=aztec%20empire</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p59ad99259d080c28" name="p59ad99259d080c28"> ¶ </a>After the filename (<code>/search</code>), the URL continues with a question
mark, after which the parameters follow. This request has one
parameter, called <code>q</code> (for 'query', presumably), whose value is <code>aztec
empire</code>. The <code>%20</code> part corresponds to a space. There are a number of
characters that can not occur in these values, such as spaces,
ampersands, or question marks. These are 'escaped' by replacing them
with a <code>%</code> followed by their numerical value<a class="footref" href="#footnote1">1</a>, which serves the same

values. It also usually contains a 'submit' button and, invisible to
the user, an 'action' URL to which it should be sent. When the submit

that this form should encode the values it is given as URL parameters,
as shown before. There is an alternative method for sending

the <code>post</code> method puts the values of its parameters in this data block

that are a mile wide, so <code>post</code> is usually more convenient. But the
difference between the two methods is not just a question of
convenience. Traditionally, <code>get</code> requests are used for requests that
just ask the server for some document, while <code>post</code> requests are used
to take an action that changes something on the server. For example,
getting a list of recent messages on an Internet forum would be a
<code>get</code> request, while adding a new message would be a <code>post</code> request.
There is a good reason why most pages follow this distinction ―
programs that automatically explore the web, such as those used by
search engines, will generally only make <code>get</code> requests. If changes to
a site can be made by <code>get</code> requests, these well-meaning 'crawlers'

web programming is no walk in the park. It can, at times, be a very
painful ordeal. Why? Because programs that are supposed to run on the
client computer generally have to work for all popular browsers. Each
of these browsers tends to work slightly different. To make things
worse, each of them contains a unique set of problems. Do not assume
that a program is bug-free just because it was made by a multi-billion
dollar company. So it is up to us, the web-programmer, to rigorously
test our programs, figure out what goes wrong, and find ways to work
around it.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1b88caf4f7052db" name="p1b88caf4f7052db"> ¶ </a>Some of you might think &quot;I will just report any problems/<a name="key28"></a>bugs I find
to the browser manufacturers, and they will certainly solve fix them
immediately&quot;. These people are in for a major disappointment. The most
recent version of Internet Explorer, the browser that is still used by
some seventy percent of web-surfers (and that every web-developer
likes to rag on) still contains bugs that have been known for over
five years. Serious bugs, too.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p21f1b49e9fa83773" name="p21f1b49e9fa83773"> ¶ </a>But do not let that discourage you. With the right kind of
obsessive-compulsive mindset, such problems provide wonderful
challenges. And for those of us who do not like wasting our time,
being careful and avoiding the obscure corners of the browser's
functionality will generally prevent you from running into too much
trouble.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p58bddd3ddb98c58a" name="p58bddd3ddb98c58a"> ¶ </a>Bugs aside, the by-design differences in interface between browsers
still make for an interesting challenge. The current situation looks
something like this: On the one hand, there are all the 'small'
browsers: Firefox, Safari, and Opera are the most important ones, but
there are more. These browsers all make a reasonable effort to adhere
to a set of standards that have been developed, or are being
developed, by the W3C, an organisation that tries to make the Web a
less confusing place by defining standard interfaces for things like
this. On the other hand, there is Internet Explorer, Microsoft's
browser, which rose to dominance in a time when many of these
standards did not really exist yet, and hasn't made much effort to
adjust itself to what other people are doing.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p68cd52aa0c7f1c75" name="p68cd52aa0c7f1c75"> ¶ </a>In some areas, such as the way the content of an HTML document can be
approached from JavaScript (<a href="chapter12.html">chapter 12</a>), the standards are based on the
method that Internet Explorer invented, and things work more or less
the same on all browsers. In other areas, such as the way events
(mouse-clicks, key-presses, and such) are handled (<a href="chapter13.html">chapter 13</a>), Internet
Explorer works radically different from other browsers.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1f02739b0b86908b" name="p1f02739b0b86908b"> ¶ </a>For a long time, owing partially to the cluelessness of the average
JavaScript developer, and partially to the fact that browser
incompatibilities were much worse when browsers like Internet Explorer
version 4 or 5 and old versions of Netscape were still common, the
usual way to deal with such differences was to detect which browser
the user was running, and litter code with alternate solutions for
each browser ― if this is Internet Explorer, do this, if this is
Netscape, do that, and if this is other browser that we didn't think
of, just hope for the best. You can imagine how hideous, confusing,
and long such programs were.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p79c0429cd5e756e7" name="p79c0429cd5e756e7"> ¶ </a>Many sites would also just refuse to load when opened in a browser
that was 'not supported'. This caused a few of the minor browsers to
swallow their pride and pretend they were Internet Explorer, just so
they would be allowed to load such pages. The properties of the
<a name="key29"></a><code>navigator</code> object contain information about the browser that a page
was loaded in, but because of such lying this information is not
particularly reliable. See what yours says<a class="footref" href="#footnote2">2</a>:</p><pre class="code"><span class="variable">forEachIn</span>(<span class="variable">navigator</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="variabledef">name</span>, <span class="variabledef">value</span>) {

});</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4a14a9ef8ee4464d" name="p4a14a9ef8ee4464d"> ¶ </a>A better approach is to try and 'isolate' our programs from
differences in browsers. If you need, for example, to find out more
about an event, such as the clicks we handled by setting the <code>onclick</code>
property of our send button, you have to look at the top-level object
called <code>event</code> on Internet Explorer, but you have to use the first
argument passed to the event-handling function on other browsers. To
handle this, and a number of other differences related to events, one
can write a helper function for attaching events to things, which
takes care of all the plumbing and allows the event-handling functions
themselves to be the same for all browsers. In <a href="chapter13.html">chapter 13</a> we will write
such a function.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1e19541a30477d05" name="p1e19541a30477d05"> ¶ </a>(Note: The browser quirks mentioned in the following chapters refer to

specific information online. The interface documentation for the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_DOM_Reference">Firefox</a>

obscure browsers such as Konqueror, but this has not been extensively
checked. Fortunately, these previous-generation browsers have pretty
much died out, and are hardly used anymore.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p35a7fa9a8037d35e" name="p35a7fa9a8037d35e"> ¶ </a>There is, however, a group of web-users that will still use a browser

often a good idea to start with a plain HTML system that works, and
then add non-essential tricks and conveniences with JavaScript.</p></div><ol class="footnotes"><li><a name="footnote1"></a>The value a character gets is decided by the ASCII standard, which

to write a function to do most of the work for us. Before we do so,

Internet Explorer. The names of a few HTML attributes already have a
special meaning in JavaScript, and thus the corresponding object

becomes <a name="key23"></a><code>className</code>, <code>for</code> becomes <code>htmlFor</code>, and <code>checked</code> is
renamed to <code>defaultChecked</code>. On Internet Explorer, <code>setAttribute</code> and
<code>getAttribute</code> also work with these adjusted names, instead of the
original HTML names, which can be confusing. On top of that the

later in this chapter, can not be set with <code>setAttribute</code> on that

<a name="key31"></a>style-sheets. It is a big topic, and I will not discuss it entirely,
but some understanding of style-sheets is necessary for a lot of
interesting JavaScript techniques, so we will go over the basics.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p64f6941be56bc96a" name="p64f6941be56bc96a"> ¶ </a>In old-fashioned HTML, the only way to change the appearance of
elements in a document was to give them extra attributes or to wrap
them in extra tags, such as <code>center</code> to center them horizontally, or
<code>font</code> to change the font style or colour. Most of the time, this meant
that if you wanted the paragraphs or the tables in your document to
look a certain way, you had to add a bunch of attributes and tags to
<em>every single one of them</em>. This quickly adds a lot of noise to such
documents, and makes them very painful to write or change by hand.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p72fca0bf4e2a8dd2" name="p72fca0bf4e2a8dd2"> ¶ </a>Of course, people being the inventive monkeys they are, someone came
up with a solution. Style-sheets are a way to make statements like 'in
this document, all paragraphs use the Comic Sans font, and are purple,
and all tables have a thick green border'. You specify them once, at
the top of the document or in a separate file, and they affect the
whole document. Here, for example, is a style-sheet to make headers 22
points big and centered, and make paragraphs use the font and colour
mentioned earlier, when they are of the 'ugly' class.</p><pre class="preformatted">&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
  h1 {
    font-size: 22pt;

of paragraphs, ugly ones and nice ones for example, setting the style
for all <code>p</code> elements is not what you want, so <a name="key32"></a>classes can be used to
distinguish between them. The above style will only be applied to
paragraphs like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">&lt;p class=&quot;ugly&quot;&gt;Mirror, mirror...&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6c51025c01391032" name="p6c51025c01391032"> ¶ </a>And this is also the meaning of the <a name="key33"></a><code>className</code> property which was
briefly mentioned for the <code>setNodeAttribute</code> function. The <a name="key34"></a><code>style</code>

from parent nodes, and interfere with each other in complex and
interesting ways, but for the purpose of DOM programming, the most
important thing to know is that each DOM node has a <code>style</code> property,
which can be used to manipulate the style of that node, and that there
are a few kinds of styles that can be used to make nodes do
extraordinary things.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p38583625c73749a5" name="p38583625c73749a5"> ¶ </a>This <code>style</code> property refers to an object, which has properties for

does exist. Later, <code>display</code> can be set to the empty string, and the

is a common error, when setting styles like this, to forget to append
<code>&quot;px&quot;</code> to your value. In most cases, setting a style to a number
without a unit does not work, so you must add <code>&quot;px&quot;</code> for pixels, <code>&quot;%&quot;</code>

fun to play with is their size. There are style types called <code>width</code>

an tricky problem to take into account. Some browsers, in some
circumstances, take these sizes to mean the outside size of the
object, including any border and internal padding. Other browsers, in
other circumstances, use the size of the space inside of the object
instead, and do not count the width of borders and padding. Thus, if
you set the size of an object that has a border or a padding, it will
not always appear the same size.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p772ec2613c5bed6e" name="p772ec2613c5bed6e"> ¶ </a>Fortunately, you can inspect the inner and outer size of a node,

inspect or modify the document is generally not enough. We also need
to be able to detect what the user is doing, and respond to it. For
this, we will use a thing called <a name="key1"></a>event handlers. Pressed keys are
events, mouse clicks are events, even mouse motion can be seen as a
series of events. In <a href="chapter11.html">chapter 11</a>, we added an <code>onclick</code> property to a
button, in order to do something when it was pressed. This is a simple
event handler.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p36415ead7203e803" name="p36415ead7203e803"> ¶ </a>The way browser events work is, fundamentally, very simple. It is
possible to register handlers for specific event types and specific
DOM nodes. Whenever an <a name="key2"></a>event occurs, the handler for that event, if
any, is called. For some events, such as key presses, knowing just
that the event occurred is not good enough, you also want to know
which key was pressed. To store such information, every event creates
an <a name="key3"></a>event object, which the handler can look at.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4052c5cacc6778f2" name="p4052c5cacc6778f2"> ¶ </a>It is important to realise that, even though events can fire at any
time, no two handlers ever run at the same moment. If other JavaScript
code is still running, the browser waits until it finishes before it
calls the next handler. This also holds for code that is triggered in
other ways, such as with <code>setTimeout</code>. In programmer jargon, browser
JavaScript is <a name="key4"></a>single-threaded, there are never two '<a name="key5"></a>threads'
running at the same time. This is, in most cases, a good thing. It is
very easy to get strange results when multiple things happen at the
same time.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p720d0712e7504cad" name="p720d0712e7504cad"> ¶ </a>An event, when not handled, can 'bubble' through the DOM tree. What
this means is that if you click on, for example, a link in a
paragraph, any handlers associated with the link are called first. If
there are no such handlers, or these handlers do not indicate that
they have finished handling the event, the handlers for the paragraph,
which is the parent of the link, are tried. After that, the handlers
for <code>document.body</code> get a turn. Finally, if no JavaScript handlers
have taken care of the event, the browser handles it. When clicking a
link, this means that the link will be followed.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p435a5bc9218ad643" name="p435a5bc9218ad643"> ¶ </a>So, as you see, events are easy. The only hard thing about them is
that browsers, while all supporting more or less the same
functionality, support this functionality through different
interfaces. As usual, the most incompatible browser is Internet
Explorer, which ignores the standard that most other browsers follow.
After that, there is Opera, which does not properly support some
useful events, such as the <code>onunload</code> event which fires when leaving a
page, and sometimes gives confusing information about keyboard events.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1ad840eebb96a094" name="p1ad840eebb96a094"> ¶ </a>There are four event-related actions one might want to take.</p><ul><li>Registering an event handler.</li><li>Getting the event object.</li><li>Extracting information from this object.</li><li>Signalling that an event has been handled.</li></ul><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p14d4e49cdd6c8701" name="p14d4e49cdd6c8701"> ¶ </a>None of them work the same across all major browsers.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p29f2f582b585c7f3" name="p29f2f582b585c7f3"> ¶ </a>As a practice field for our event-handling, we open a document with a

in fact work across browsers, but it has an important drawback ― you

enough, but there are cases, especially when a program has to be able
to work together with other programs (which might also be adding
handlers), that this is annoying.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p53ab4448a79192fe" name="p53ab4448a79192fe"> ¶ </a><a name="key6"></a>In Internet Explorer, one can add a click handler to a

would rather not know. The Internet Explorer browser (which means, at
the time of writing, the browser used by a majority of web-surfers)
has a bug that causes values to not be cleaned up as normal: Even when
they are no longer used, they stay in the machine's memory. This is
known as a <a name="key73"></a>memory leak, and, once enough memory has been leaked,
will seriously slow down a computer.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p22f24bf084d74d4e" name="p22f24bf084d74d4e"> ¶ </a>When does this leaking occur? Due to a deficiency in Internet
Explorer's <a name="key74"></a>garbage collector, the system whose purpose it is to
reclaim unused values, when you have a DOM node that, through one of
its properties or in a more indirect way, refers to a normal
JavaScript object, and this object, in turn, refers back to that DOM
node, both objects will not be collected. This has something to do
with the fact that DOM nodes and other JavaScript objects are
collected by different systems ― the system that cleans up DOM nodes
will take care to leave any nodes that are still referenced by
JavaScript objects, and vice versa for the system that collects normal
JavaScript values.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p560d289a24cd2757" name="p560d289a24cd2757"> ¶ </a>As the above description shows, the problem is not specifically
related to event handlers. This code, for example, creates a bit of
un-collectable memory:</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="variable">jsObject</span> = {<span class="property">link</span>: <span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span>};
<span class="variable">document</span>.<span class="property">body</span>.<span class="property">linkBack</span> = <span class="variable">jsObject</span>;</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3dd3e899a4484a02" name="p3dd3e899a4484a02"> ¶ </a>Even after such an Internet Explorer browser goes to a different page,
it will still hold on to the <code>document.body</code> shown here. The reason
this bug is often associated with event handlers is that it is
extremely easy to make such circular links when registering a handler.
The DOM node keeps references to its handlers, and the handler, most
of the time, has a reference to the DOM node. Even when this reference
is not intentionally made, JavaScript's scoping rules tend to add it
implicitly. Consider this function:</p><pre class="code invalid"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">addAlerter</span>(<span class="variabledef">element</span>) {
  <span class="variable">addHandler</span>(<span class="localvariable">element</span>, <span class="string">&quot;click&quot;</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="variable">alert</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Alert! ALERT!&quot;</span>);
  });
}</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3b0788945ca0cdd9" name="p3b0788945ca0cdd9"> ¶ </a>The anonymous function that is created by the <code>addAlerter</code> function
can 'see' the <code>element</code> variable. It doesn't use it, but that does not
matter ― just because it can see it, it will have a reference to it.
By registering this function as an event handler on that same
<code>element</code> object, we have created a circle.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p274f002fddd7971a" name="p274f002fddd7971a"> ¶ </a>There are three ways to deal with this problem. The first approach, a
very popular one, is to ignore it. Most scripts will only leak a
little bit, so it takes a long time and a lot of pages before the
problems become noticeable. And, when the problems are so subtle,
who's going to hold <em>you</em> responsible? Programmers given to this
approach will often searingly denounce Microsoft for their shoddy
programming, and state that the problem is not their fault, so <em>they</em>
shouldn't be fixing it.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p425aad248cff4045" name="p425aad248cff4045"> ¶ </a>Such reasoning is not entirely without merit, of course. But when half
your users are having problems with the web-pages you make, it is hard
to deny that there is a practical problem. Which is why people working
on 'serious' sites usually make an attempt not to leak any memory.
Which brings us to the second approach: Painstakingly making sure that
no circular references between DOM objects and regular objects are
created. This means, for example, rewriting the above handler like
this:</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="variable">addAlerter</span>(<span class="variabledef">element</span>) {
  <span class="variable">addHandler</span>(<span class="localvariable">element</span>, <span class="string">&quot;click&quot;</span>, <span class="keyword">function</span>() {
    <span class="variable">alert</span>(<span class="string">&quot;Alert! ALERT!&quot;</span>);
  });
  <span class="localvariable">element</span> = <span class="atom">null</span>;
}</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p9dd7c644334aca3" name="p9dd7c644334aca3"> ¶ </a>Now the <code>element</code> variable no longer points at the DOM node, and the
handler will not leak. This approach is viable, but requires the
programmer to <em>really</em> pay attention.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p1f42dbaeb6e8d65b" name="p1f42dbaeb6e8d65b"> ¶ </a>The third solution, finally, is to not worry too much about creating
leaky structures, but to make sure to clean them up when you are done
with them. This means unregistering any event handlers when they are
no longer needed, and registering an <code>onunload</code> event to unregister
the handlers that are needed until the page is unloaded. It is
possible to extend an event-registering system, like our <code>addHandler</code>
function, to automatically do this. When taking this approach, you
must keep in mind that event handlers are not the only possible source
of memory leaks ― adding properties to DOM node objects can cause
similar problems.</p></div><h1><span class="number">Chapter 14: </span>HTTP requests</h1><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p743a85de1fe93747" name="p743a85de1fe93747"> ¶ </a>As mentioned in <a href="chapter11.html">chapter 11</a>, communication on the World Wide Web happens

follow a pattern: They start with a word that identifies the
information they contain, followed by a colon and the actual
information. These are called '<a name="key3"></a>headers'. The <code>User-Agent</code> header
tells the server which browser (or other kind of program) is being

case) the last time the file was modified, its length, and its type

collection of objects in such a way that the smallest element can be
quickly found. As promised, this appendix will explain the details
behind this data structure.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p16c209ac0cec8fab" name="p16c209ac0cec8fab"> ¶ </a>Consider again the problem we needed to solve. The A* algorithm
created large amounts of small objects, and had to keep these in an
'open list'. It was also constantly removing the smallest element from
this list. The simplest approach would be to just keep all the objects
in an array, and search for the smallest one when we need it. But,
unless we have a <em>lot</em> of time, this will not do. Finding the smallest
element in an unsorted array requires going over the whole array, and
checking each element.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p572276834a90ce58" name="p572276834a90ce58"> ¶ </a>The next solution would be, of course, to sort our array. JavaScript
arrays have a wonderful <a name="key2"></a><code>sort</code> method, which can be used to do the
heavy work. Unfortunately, re-sorting a whole array every time an
element is added is more work than searching for a minimum value in
an unsorted array. Some tricks can be used, such as, instead of
re-sorting the whole array, just making sure new values are inserted
in the right place so that the array, which was sorted before, stays
sorted. This is coming closer to the approach a binary heap uses
already, but inserting a value in the middle of an array requires
moving all the elements after it one place up, which is still just too
slow.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p133087e88d1a67df" name="p133087e88d1a67df"> ¶ </a>Another approach is to not use an array at all, but to store the
values in a set of interconnected objects. A simple form of this is to
have every object hold one value and two (or less) links to other
objects. There is one root object, holding the smallest value, which
is used to access all the other objects. Links always point to objects
holding greater values, so the whole structure looks something like
this:</p><div class="illustration"><img src="img/tree.png"/></div><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p27ce575d43ee567" name="p27ce575d43ee567"> ¶ </a>Such structures are usually called <a name="key3"></a>trees, because of the way they
branch. Now, when you need the smallest element, you just take off the
top element and rearrange the tree so that one of the top element's
children ― the one with the lowest value ― becomes the new top. When
inserting new elements, you 'descend' the tree until you find an
element less than the new element, and insert it there. This takes a
lot less searching than a sorted array does, but it has the
disadvantage of creating a lot of objects, which also slows things
down.</p></div><hr/><div class="block"><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7859b5b1b88ff0df" name="p7859b5b1b88ff0df"> ¶ </a>A binary heap, then, does make use of a sorted array, but it is only
partially sorted, much like the tree above. Instead of objects, the
positions in the array are used to form a tree, as this picture tries
to show:</p><div class="illustration"><img src="img/heap.png"/></div><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p7867b77b4b2c7639" name="p7867b77b4b2c7639"> ¶ </a>Array element <code>1</code> is the root of the tree, array element <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>
are its children, and in general array element <code>X</code> has children <code>X *
2</code> and <code>X * 2 + 1</code>. You can see why this structure is called a 'heap'.
Note that this array starts at <code>1</code>, while JavaScript arrays start at
<code>0</code>. The heap will always keep the smallest element in position <code>1</code>,
and make sure that for every element in the array at position <code>X</code>, the
element at <code>X / 2</code> (round down) is smaller.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p306dfd56ae39b23a" name="p306dfd56ae39b23a"> ¶ </a>Finding the smallest element is now a matter of taking the element at
position <code>1</code>. But when this element is removed, the heap must make
sure that there are no holes left in the array. To do this, it takes
the last element in the array and moves it to the start, and then
compares it to its child elements at position <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. It is
likely to be greater, so it is exchanged with one of them, and the
process of comparing it with its children is repeated for the new
position, and so on, until it comes to a position where its children
are greater, or a position where it has no children.</p><pre class="preformatted">[2, 3, 5, 4, 8, 7, 6]
Take out 2, move 6 to the front.
[6, 3, 5, 4, 8, 7]
6 is greater than its first child 3, so swap them.
[3, 6, 5, 4, 8, 7]
Now 6 has children 4 and 8 (position 4 and 5). It is greater than
4, so we swap again.
[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7]
6 is in position 4, and has no more children. The heap is in order
again.</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p4e546a29c19b6c57" name="p4e546a29c19b6c57"> ¶ </a>Similarly, when an element has to be added to the heap, it is put at
the end of the array and allowed to 'bubble' up by repeatedly
exchanging it with its parent, until we find a parent that is less
than the new node.</p><pre class="preformatted">[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7]
Element 2 gets added again, it starts at the back.
[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 2]
2 is in position 7, its parent is at 3, which is a 5. 5 is greater
than 2, so we swap.
[3, 4, 2, 6, 8, 7, 5]
The parent of position 3 is position 1. Again, we swap.
[2, 4, 3, 6, 8, 7, 5]
The element can not go further than position 1, so we are done.</pre><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p32a5a6cbb1fc90f1" name="p32a5a6cbb1fc90f1"> ¶ </a>Note how adding or inserting an element does not require it to be
compared with every element in the array. In fact, because the jumps
